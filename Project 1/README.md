This is my project 1. It is rather simple but it outputs the drives you have on your computer, the total Size of the drives in GB, and how much space you have left on the hard drives in GB. To run the script download it, open it in Powershell ISE and run it.

The output should look similar to this:
DeviceID  Size(GB)  Free Space(GB)
C:             31              13
