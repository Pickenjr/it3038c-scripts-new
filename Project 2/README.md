Welcome to my second project.
This script will give you basic information about your system hardware, including the CPU name, the amount of cores, RAM utilization, and hard drive utilization.
In order for this script to run you need to have both python and psutil installed and be on the Windows operating system.
If you don't have Python, please navigate to Python.org/downloads and download the latest version.
If you don't have psutil please run the following command after installing Python "pip3 install psutil"
Now you should be able to just download and run this script.
